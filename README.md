# DonorFund

## Objective
Non-profits often face limited resources for fundraising and must maximize their return on investment from fundraising efforts. This project aims to optimize fundraising efforts using donor data by identifying high-potential donors who are more likely to contribute at higher levels. This will ultimatley help non-profits allocate resources more effecively and design target fundraising strategies

## Goals
1. Classify donors into high, medium, and low potential groups based on their giving patterns
2. Find key factors (demographic, behavioral, etc.) that influence high-value donations
3. Provide actionable recommendations for non-profits to focus their efforts on high-potential donors
